# 🔐 Cross-Platform OTP Authenticator

A versatile Open-Source One-Time Password (OTP) authenticator application built with Dart, supporting multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, Web, Android, iOS, and macOS.

[中文版 README](./readme-zh.md)
## 🤔 Why This Project?

While Google Authenticator is a popular choice for OTP, it has some limitations:

1. 📵 It only supports Android and iOS, making it inconvenient for desktop users.
2. 🔒 It's device-based, which means you can't easily access your codes across multiple devices. (God knows every time I need an OTP but I don't know where my phone is!)
3. 🔒 Limited backup and transfer options for your OTP setups. (Of course I don't want to bind to one software!)

This project aims to solve these issues by providing a cross-platform solution that allows you to use OTP codes on your preferred device, whether it's your phone, tablet, or computer. Additionally, our QR code export feature ensures you're never locked into our app - you can easily transfer your OTPs to other authenticator apps or create backups.

### Not supported
Feel free to post issue for platforms with standard OTP but not supported for this app. ❤️

## ✨ Data Security

### Local mode

When user chose to use local mode, data will be stored locally. Clean the app data will lose the data stored.

### Cloud mode
The data visibility is restricted to each unique id.
This is ensured by [Row-Level-Security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) rules.
```sql
alter policy "Only enable read access for this users"
on "authenticated"."user_data"
to authenticated
using (
  (( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) = user_id)
);
```
